title: The Toy's Party
---

There were two children. Their names were Jack and Anne. They had many toys that they looked after very well. They both had toys according to their interest but they played with all the toys together. Every night when the household slept, they would start talking and playing.

One day all the toys were excited. Among them was a doll by the name Lucy and it was her birthday. Soon it was night and everyone except the toys was sleeping. The dolls made the food and the other toys setup the room.

Lucy even wanted to call Jack and Anne. So, she went to call them. She called them in a soft voice but they were amazed to see her. However, they knew it was true because they had sometimes heard voices in the room while playing and they guessed that it was the toys.

She told to come to the room and then they saw everything. Soon, the party resumed. Everyone had fun. It went on till 3 in the morning and then they went to bed hoping that the toys will have more parties.
