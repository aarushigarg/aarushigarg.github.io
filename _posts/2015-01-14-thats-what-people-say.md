title: That's What People Say
---

Fuzzy shine makes the world bright  
So does the sun, right?

And do the moon and stars  
Which are very far

That's what people say  
That's what people say

The Sun is made of gas  
And the Earth is made of mass

The moon is made of rocks  
At which people mock

That's what people say  
That's what people say
