title: Have You Ever Seen
---

Have you ever seen the Sun in the sky  
Have you ever seen the stars so high  
Have you ever seen the worms in the ground  
Oh! They are always to be found

If you've seen the Sun and the stars  
Have you ever wondered  
What would happen  
If they were in the ground

If you've seen the worms in the ground  
Have you wondered  
What would happen  
If they were in the sky
